# GeoTech: Soil Analysis and Data Management System

## Overview
GeoTech is a desktop application designed for soil analysis and data management. This application is capable of determining various soil parameters, including particle size distribution constants and soil density using core-cutter and sandcone methods. It also stores details of soil samples in a MySQL database and uses OxyPlot to generate particle size distribution graphs. The application is developed using Microsoft Visual Studio IDE and the .NET framework.
